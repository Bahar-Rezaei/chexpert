We forked an existing MIT project called Chexpert. Their code is our AI system that is being audited. 
The system receives chest X-rays and suggests diagnosis, using Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.  

We also used other versions of the same project (the MIT project was a competition) to develop a better view. 
An example that was especially helpful is: https://github.com/gaetandi/cheXpert 

We downloaded extra data from Stanford AIMI Shared Datasets: https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/datasets/23c56a0d-15de-405b-87c8-99c30138950c 
The data is annotated by multiple experts (radiologists). We combined these different expert suggestions and made data we called ground truth.

We used this data, which is unseen by the AI system, to test the system. We compare the performance of our system with the performance of an expert.

We showed that using AI improves the diagnosing performance both in terms of time and accuracy for most disease categories.
